# The Stp Format - Technomotion's Stepdata Format 
This document will attempt to document the workings of Technomotion's
Step format, used by the game for storage of game step data.

Note that until I get things more organized, this doc will probably be
more a smattering of brainfarts, as opposed to something coherent.


## File Start:
Each Stp file I've looked at seems to start the same way.

2 bytes with the value 0xFFFE (appearing as FE FF due to intel processors being Little Endian),
followed by 30 empty bytes (that is, each byte having a value of 0x00).
